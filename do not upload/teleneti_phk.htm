<BODY><XMP>   Here are instructions for using TELENET.  There are some very basic things,
which most people already know, and some other things, which even the most
dedicated hackers have probably never even heard of.  This includes things such
as international access, etc.  Well, have fun.


			THE TELENET CONNECTION
	INTERNATIONAL ADDRESSING/INTERNATIONAL ACCESS PROCEDURES


I.  TELENET INTERNATIONAL ADDRESS FORMAT

	  212 141	   3110 21200141
	  909  84	   3110 90900084



II.   ACCESS TO OVERSEAS PUBLIC DATA NETWORKS

1.  Turn on the terminal and coupler.
2.  Dial the nearest Telenet access number (See Telenet Public Dial listing).
    When you hear a high-pitched tone, place the telephone
    receiver in the coupler.

     For Data Sets (Bell 103 or 113 type), depress the data button.

3.  Type Two carriage returns (CR).
4.  Telenet will give you a port identification number and ask you
    to identify your terminal type in the two or four
    character id for your terminal followed by a carriage
    return (CR) or type carriage return (CR).

      (EX.)	TELENET
		202 DL9
		TERMINAL = AJ63(CR)

5.  After Telenet prompts with a '@' type 'ID', skip a space (SP)
    and type your password followed by a carriage return.  (Contact
    your GTE Telenet Representative to obtain a required caller
    paid ID.)

      (EX.)	@ID(SP);INTL(CR)

    Type in your password.

      (EX.)	PASSWORD = 123456(CR)

6.  After Telenet prompts with an @, type a C. skip a space and
    type the network address of the computer you wish to access,
    followed by a carriage return (CR).

      (EX.)	@C(SP)023411234567890(CR)

    Note:  Your International address will follow a format such as:

	   020801234567890 for France/Transpac
	   023421234567890 for United Kingdom/British Telecom
	   026241234567890 for Germany/Datex-P

7.  Telenet will respond with a connection message.  You are now
    ready to begin your conversation with the host computer.

      (EX.)	(ADDRESS)CONNECTED

8.  To disconnect from your computer, log off as usual.  Telenet
    will send you a disconnected message.

      (EX.)	(ADDRESS)DISCONNECTED

    Hang up to disconnect from Telenet.

(CR) = Carriage return
(SP) = Space
