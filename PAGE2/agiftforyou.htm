&nbsp;
     She paced the floor her body trembling in anticipation of his arrival. 
She had made all the preparations for his birthday surprise and now couldn't
wait to see the look on his face at the gift she so carefully had thought out. 
She glanced again at her reflection in the mirror,   she was pleased with what
she had accomplished and knew he would be as well.  Her hair piled high with
sweeping tendrils gave her a look of classic beauty.  The deep decolletage of
the red satin gown highlighted the bounty of her breasts.  She had paid close
attention to the added scent of cologne, dabbing where she thought he would be
sure to smell.  No jewelry adorned her this time she opted for the elegance of
simplicity.
&nbsp;
     She had arranged the entire evening and wanted it to go well.  The
adrenaline that flowed thru her veins even now was caused by the perfection of
her gift.  She had such deep, abiding feeling for him that she wanted him to be
pleased and excited as well.  She could not deny her own enthusiasm. 
&nbsp;
     He walked into the room and busily undid his outerwear  then curiously
turned to her and her silence.  He stopped suddenly and gazed at the woman he
had grown so fond of.  He had seen her dressed in an array of fashions and was
always surprised to find that whatever she chose to wear was perfectly suited
to her.  Today was no different.  He genuinely smiled and felt the tug of
arousal at the alluring picture she presented.  
&nbsp;
     "I have a surprise for you." Her eyes shone with the excitement of a child
and he responded in kind to her obvious piquancy.
&nbsp;
     "Well, we both know how much I like surprises."  His grin spoke of past
wonderments that he and she  had shared.  He was constantly shocked by her
ability to surprise him.
&nbsp;
     "This particular surprise is actually for us both to share."  She smiled
seductively and whispered "Follow me".  
&nbsp;
     It never entered his mind not to follow her.  She walked slightly ahead of
him and he watched as the satin clung hungrily to her form and smelled as her
fragrance wafted to his nostrils.  Wild thoughts shifted through his head as he
followed  trance-like.  She led him upstairs to the waiting bedroom then turned
to look at him.  She kissed him then full on the lips and he wanted to linger
over the taste of her but she pulled slightly back and said..
&nbsp;
     "Happy Birthday Darling" as she opened the door.  He stood transfixed in
space and time.   She was a devil and always seemed to be able to challenge him
with surprise after surprise.  This was more than he could ever have asked for,
  more than he could have dreamed she would give.
&nbsp;
     There lying naked upon the bed was a woman.. Her body although some would
find fault with somehow he saw as perfection.  She lifted her head languidly up
off the pillow and stared up at him.  Her eyes were crystal blue and spoke of a
certain innocence but her demeanor and her movements spoke of a sensual
knowing.  His body, still in shock reacted.  He looked at the wonderful woman
that had planned this and he could see in her face the excitement that the
whole idea had brought to her as well.
&nbsp;
     Silently she walked to the woman on the bed and sat beside her.  Her hand
reached to the exposed breast and without looking away from him she bent to
suck slightly on the not yet hardened nipple.  He stood glued to the floor,
watching as her lips pursed over the soft pink flesh of the other woman.  He
wondered how he would contain his excitement. 
&nbsp;
      Her tongue darted out and begin to make lazy circles around the aureola
as the tiny bud peaked like a flower offering itself up to solstice.  He
watched eagerly as she allowed her tongue to lie flat against the nipple then
as her mouth enveloped the entire pink.  He heard as well as saw the sucking
motion causing a slight indentation of her cheeks.  The unknown woman looked at
him then leisurely allowing her head to fall back in oblivion.  Soft mewling
sounds escaped from her mouth.
&nbsp;
     He continued to watch as her hand began tracing down the stomach of the
woman,  her fingers rhythmically swaying back and forth, tunneling down to the
apex of the her thighs.   The young woman arched slightly to the feel of ginger
fingertips then wantonly allowed her legs to fall open.  She lay totally
exposed to him.  The light thatch barely covering the treasure beneath.  He
watched as her fingers came to the line of pubic hair.  He marveled at the
contrast of coloring,  the unknown woman pale compared to his love who was
darker with an olive cast.
&nbsp;
     Her fingers continued to travel until with a slight pressure she dipped
between the folds of the pale golden covering.  Her mouth left the breast as
her hands begin to fondle gently.  She stood then and came to him and slowly
raised her fingertips to his lips.  He smelled the sweet muskiness seconds
before opening his mouth to suck.  Her eyes met his as he lapped hungrily at
the salty sweetness of this other woman.  He saw the willingness and the eager
desire that mirrored his own wants.  Slowly she began to unbutton his shirt. 
He wanted to help but still felt surreal.  This couldn't be happening.  She
quickly divested him of shirt, then pants and finally boxers.
&nbsp;
      She knelt easily in front of him, capturing his harden phallus in her
hand and then her mouth.  So many times before he had felt that mouth and knew
the awe of it's power.  She allowed her tongue to swirl around the tip then
quickly without warning she sucked him completely into her mouth.  He gasped
with her ardor, she stopped just as suddenly and moved back to the bed.  His
hands went to his chest almost to assure himself it was real. 
&nbsp;
     Her hands again began to trace up the shapely legs of the other woman, 
all the while the woman stretched and moaned like a feline cat.  Her legs still
open and slightly arched allowed both he and his love to witness the moisture
that now beaded up upon her mound.  He watched the darker hands slide closer to
that opening and licked his lips in anticipation.  When at last they reached, 
fingers gently opening,  spreading the tender flesh he could see the motion of
clenching muscles that allowed a near wink.    
&nbsp;
     "Come darling..... it's all for you."  He heard her voice like a bell and
he fell forward to see more closely the haven that awaited.  His tongue reached
forward and licked slowly down the crevice.  Then finding and capturing the
tiny hooded bud began to nibble.  With full lips around he pulled her into his
mouth and sucked vigorously as the natural flow of her juices began to saturate
his face.
   
     He looked up to see the responses of both women and his eyes caught the
descent of his woman's mouth again capturing the peaked nipple and sucking. 
The unknown woman was reeling now.. Her body uncontrollably arched to the
onslaught of both mouths that devoured her.  He could barely contain his own
passion, causing his blood to boil.  Her hot panting breaths echoing in his
head.. He wanted more.   He wanted to be inside.
&nbsp;
     He stood now and watched as the darker beauty raised and sensed his need. 
Her hands again found his cock.  He nearly burst with the touch alone but
contained his need as she guided him to the waiting portal that was opened to
him.  He watched as her hand remained grasped around the base and the head of
his penis pierced the soft, pink flesh.  The entrance was warm,  dewy and he
slid in easily. His body's demand for release forced his hips to move without
much thought.
&nbsp;
     He watched as the darker beauty moved and positioned herself above the
open mouth of the stranger.  His eyes bulged as he saw the slow descent of cunt
to mouth.  Nothing in his wildest imagination could match what he was feeling. 
Her hips began to undulate and grind against the opened mouth and the moans and
groans of all three echoed in his head.
&nbsp;
     She reached to kiss him and his mind and body reeled.  His own hips began
to thrust nearly involuntarily.  The magic of the moment was enhanced by the
sorceress he called lover.  She manipulated herself against the hungry mouth in
rhythm with his thrusts.
 
     The orgasm came powerfully, shockingly hard.  His body wracked with
spasms.  His eyes closed momentarily, then opened to watch as she reached for
her own release.  He thought he'd never seen anything more beautiful as the
climax of his lover.
&nbsp;
     The woman who's body they had both used briefly forgotten.
&nbsp;
     She collapsed then against her and giggles bubbled up.  He fell to the
side of both women and tried to catch his breath.
&nbsp;
     "Is my birthday only once a year?" 
 
     "Yes Darlin, but it lasts for 24 hours"    And the promise of more was all
he needed to regain his composure.
