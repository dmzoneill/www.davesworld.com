Ways to send a car to Hell            by The Jolly Roger<br>
<br>
There are 1001 ways to destroy a car but I am going to cover only<br>
the ones that are the most fun (for you), the most destructive<br>
(for them), and the hardest to trace (for the cops).<br>
<br>
- Place thermite on the hood, light it, and watch it burn all the<br>
way through the pavement!<br>
<br>
- Tape a CO2 bomb to the hood, axel, gas tank, wheel, muffler,<br>
etc.)<br>
<br>
- Put a tampon, dirt, sugar (this one is good!), a ping pong ball,<br>
or just about anything that will dissolve in the gas tank.<br>
Plastic deforms and dilutes into gas.  The final result is much<br>
harder to inject into the engine, possibly causing valve replacement.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Put potatoes, rocks, banannas, or anything that will fit, into<br>
the tailpipe. Use a broom handle to stuff 'em up into the<br>
tailpipe.<br>
<br>
- Put a long rag into the gas tank and light it...<br>
<br>
- Steal a key, copy it, replace it, and then steal the stereo.<br>
<br>
- Break into the car. Cut a thin metal ruler into a shape like<br>
this:<br>
             ÚÄÄ¿       (Revised ill. 4.14)<br>
             ³  ³<br>
             ³  ³<br>
             ³  ³<br>
             ³  ³<br>
             ³ ÚÙ<br>
             ³ À¿<br>
             ÀÄÄÙ<br>
<br>
Slide it into the outside window and keep pulling it back up until<br>
you catch the lock cable which should unlock the door. This device<br>
is also called a SLIM JIM. Now get the stereo, equalizer, radar<br>
detector, etc. Now destroy the inside. (A sharp knife does wonders<br>
on the seats!)<br>
<br>
Have Fun!                                    -= Exodus =-<br>
